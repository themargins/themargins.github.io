            On Attention, Craft, and Leaving Space

        <p>
          Most things worth making benefit from being left alone long enough to
          reveal what they actually want to become. Attention, when applied too
          early or too forcefully, has a way of flattening subtlety.
        </p>

        <p>
          This is particularly true of creative work. The urge to optimize,
          explain, brand, or polish too soon often produces something that is
          technically correct and emotionally inert.
        </p>

        <h2>Constraint as a form of care</h2>

        <p>
          Limitation is often misunderstood as deprivation. In practice, it is
          closer to an act of care. Choosing fewer tools, fewer colors, fewer
          words is a way of saying: <em>this deserves to be seen clearly</em>.
        </p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>
            What is left unsaid often carries more weight than what is explained
            exhaustively.
          </p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>
          In writing, this shows up as line length, spacing, and rhythm. A page
          that breathes invites the reader to slow down. A page that shouts asks
          only to be skimmed.
        </p>

        <h2>Designing for reading</h2>

        <p>
          Good reading experiences share a few quiet traits: generous margins,
          consistent cadence, and a sense that nothing is trying too hard. The
          best compliment a layout can receive is invisibility.
        </p>

        <p>
          This site is an attempt to practice that restraint. It favors
          longevity over novelty, clarity over cleverness, and presence over
          scale.
        </p>

        <h2>Closing</h2>

        <p>
          If something here feels slower than you expect, that is intentional.
          Some things are better encountered without urgency.
