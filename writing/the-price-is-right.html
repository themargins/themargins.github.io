        <p>
          I sit at the blink fitness seated leg curl machine, 
          in between sets of curling 100 and 110lbs, and the front of me hanging 
          from the ceiling is a small flat screen TV showing participants of the game 
          show "the price is right" salivating over a new sporty cobalt blue BMW, and 
          losing their mind over an all expenses covered vacation to Borneo, for one 
          participant, and Fiji for the other. For a moment I'm disgusted at how much 
          they are losing composure over such seemingly simple pleasures, what about 
          the pursuit of the intangibles? Truth, art, beauty, mastery, wisdom, craft…etc.? 
          Or perhaps I'm just justifying why I'm not sitting in a first class seat, 
          shredding Parmesan over my dish and twirling decadent pasta around my 
          compostable Emirate airline fork, but am instead sitting in a seated 
          leg curl machine curling my legs and trying to getting shredded.
